              <h2>THE GOLDEN AGE</h2>

              <h2>GHOSTS IN THE MACHINE</h2>
              <p>They had names—Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Space Invaders. Simple sprites that became mythology. We memorized their patterns, learned their tells, and called them by name like old friends.</p>

              <h2>THE HIGH SCORE TABLE</h2>
              <p>Three letters. That's all you got to immortalize yourself. AAA. Your initials burned into phosphor, proof that you were here, that you mattered, that you conquered the machine—if only for a moment.</p>
