            <h2>The First Fold</h2>
            <p>In the village of Mizuhara, where the cherry blossoms fell like whispered secrets, there lived an old paper maker named Yuki. Her hands, weathered like ancient parchment, knew the soul of every sheet she created.</p>

            <h2>The Mountain Crease</h2>
            <p>Each morning, she would tell her granddaughter Hana: "The paper remembers. Every fold we make becomes part of its story. Press firmly at the mountain, gently at the valley."</p>

            <p>Hana learned that senbazuru—a thousand paper cranes—could grant a single wish. She began folding on the day the autumn moon hung low, her fingers dancing with determination and dreams.</p>

            <p>By the five-hundredth crane, her wish had changed three times. First for fortune, then for love, finally for something she could not name—a feeling like sunlight through rice paper.</p>

            <p>On the morning of the thousandth crane, Yuki smiled. "What will you wish for?" she asked. Hana held the final crane to her heart: "I wish for more time—to fold, to learn, to sit beside you."</p>
