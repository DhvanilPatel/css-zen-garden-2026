                    <h2>Whispers Before the Storm</h2>
                    <p>Old Marlowe knew it was coming three days before the first cloud appeared. His bones ached with the memory of a thousand storms, each one etched into his weathered frame like rings in ancient oak.</p>

                    <p>"The sky speaks to those who listen," he told his granddaughter Vera, pointing to the horizon where copper light bled into violet. "Tonight, the giants will dance."</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"In every flash, I see the universe writing its oldest poem—chaos shaped into light, fury transformed into wonder."</p>
                        <cite>— From the journals of Dr. Elena Stormwright, Storm Chaser</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>The Night Electric</h2>
                    <p>When the first bolt split the darkness, Vera understood. The lightning wasn't destruction—it was conversation. Each flash illuminated truths hidden in shadow: the fox frozen mid-stride, the owl's wings spread wide, the river turned to molten silver.</p>

                    <p>The storm raged for seven hours. Seven hours of thunder that shook the valley. Seven hours of rain that washed away the dust of drought. Seven hours of light that photographed eternity in milliseconds.</p>

                    <h2>After the Fury</h2>
                    <p>Dawn arrived wrapped in mist and silence. The air tasted clean, electric, newborn. Where lightning had struck the old pine on Miller's Ridge, a spiral scar now climbed its trunk—nature's signature, written in carbon black.</p>

                    <p>Marlowe found Vera on the porch, sketching the pattern in her notebook. "The storm left us a message," she said, not looking up. Her pencil moved like lightning itself—quick, certain, alive.</p>
