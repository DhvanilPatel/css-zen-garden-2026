        <h2>Captain Elara's Final Voyage</h2>
        <p>
          The <em>Windchaser</em> cut through the morning swells like a blade through silk.
          Captain Elara Thornwood gripped the wheel, her weathered hands reading the sea's
          whispered secrets through the ship's trembling hull.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thirty years I've sailed these waters," she murmured to no one but the gulls,
          "and still the ocean shows me something new each dawn."

        <h2>The Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter</h2>
        <p>
          Mira collected sea glass the way other children collected stamps—with obsessive
          devotion and an eye for the extraordinary. Her father's lighthouse stood sentinel
          on the rocky outcrop of Barnacle Point, its beam sweeping the darkness like a
          golden promise.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "The sea gives back what it takes," her grandmother used to say, "just never
          in the same form."

        <h2>Tides of Memory</h2>
        <p>
          Every seventh wave, the old sailors claimed, carries the memories of drowned
          ships. Fisherman Jonas Reef had learned to count them, waiting for that seventh
          swell to bring him news from the deep.
        </p>
        <p>
          His daughter thought him mad. His grandson knew better. Some truths only reveal
          themselves to those patient enough to listen to the rhythm of the tides.
