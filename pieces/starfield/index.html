            <p>Every point of light you see has traveled millions of years to reach your eyes. Some of these stars have already died, their light a ghost crossing the cosmic ocean.</p>

            <p>The nebulae paint the darkness with the ashes of ancient suns, creating nurseries where new stars are born. In this endless cycle, atoms that once burned in stellar cores now form your eyes as you gaze upward.</p>

            <blockquote>
                We are made of star-stuff contemplating the stars.
            </blockquote>

            <p>The void between stars is not empty but filled with possibility, a canvas of potential waiting for light to illuminate the next chapter of cosmic evolution.</p>
